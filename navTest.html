          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <div><p>New Heights Ladder Co. started out in 1978 as a small shop in northern Alberta, mainly selling to painters and storage companies. The company was founded by Henery Jones and Janet Wiggins. They started out as partners but in 1983 they made an arrangement and split the partnership. Henry is currently the CEO of the company while Janet is a owner and regional manager for a select few stores in Alberta. Slowly over the years they expanded across Canada coast to coast, and in 2005 they expanded to the U.S..
